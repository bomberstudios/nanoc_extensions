# nanoc extensions

This is a playground for [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org) plugins, filters and commands.

Feel free to make with them as you please.

## filters/

### copy.rb

A dumb filter that copies a binary asset to the output folder. Coded as an example of how a binary filter works.

### sips_flatten.rb

Uses the 'sips' command line tool in Mac OS X to flatten Fireworks images. Output format can be defined in the asset's YAML file using the 'flatten_format' property:

      binary: true
      filters: ['sips_flatten']
      flatten_format: 'png'

where `flatten_format` can be `png` (the default), `jpeg`, `tiff`, `gif`, `jp2`, `pict`, `bmp`, `qtif`, `psd`, `sgi` or `tga`.

It supports multiple asset representations, so you can output multiple formats by having a YAML like:

      binary: true
      filters: ['sips_flatten']
      reps:
        default:
          flatten_format: 'png'
          custom_path: /assets/image.png
        jpg:
          flatten_format: 'jpeg'
          custom_path: /assets/image.jpg
